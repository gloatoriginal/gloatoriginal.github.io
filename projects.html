        <h3>Active Directory Domain Controller Windows Server 2016 and 2019</h3>
        <i><p>*High Level Description*</p></i>
        <p>
            I created a centralized server to use as a database for new users that are added into the company, I than implemented 
            a configuration to automatically install windows across multiple devices on the network that the server sits on. As well I created
            roaming profiles and network based configurations for new and past users to have centralized data and settings. With these tools 
            some companys can see exponential rates of effeciency due to automated processes handling otherwise human manual tasks.

        <p>I promoted Windows server 2016 & 2019 as a domain controller and DHCP server, than created users and implemented specifc group
            policies to help delegate control across the domain. With this set up I created a VM using Hyper-V in Windows 10 Pro, than used
            my windows server Local IP as the DNS server for my new client. I was able to login to my domain with a created user, I had a 
            restricted user and an admin user that I was able to freely move from group to group. Now that I had my users in their correct OUs
            I moved to Roaming profiles for each user, each user than had their own alotted directory that sat on the server, but still had 
            the luxury of appearing as a local filesystem with that users name. After this I was able to create RAID array's using virtual
            disks that I gave to my VM using Hyper-V, for extra practice I continuelly ran Checkpoints during each step of the installation
            and saved those checkpoints to a second physical hard disk that was separate to the main VM incase of any failures. With 3 virtual
            disks alotted to my server I was able to create RAID 5 with 3 disks to incorporate striping with parity. After this I also created
            a software RAID 1 mirrored. With my domain controller so in depth and advanced, I didn't want to lose anything configuration wise,
            I implemented DFS to have replications scheduled periodically on my server. Amazing stuff, the next thing that server can do was
            PXE Boot! I installed PXE boot and made sure clients were receiving my DHCP range, I than downloaded the windows 10 ISO and 
            mounted the iso to see the files like a folder, I could than grab the boot.wim file, this is going to be the file that boots
            initially after the bios and loads windows into the running memory, over the network. I was able to configure this and point my pxe server
            to my boot.wim location, I than booted my server in UEFI and was off to the races. Once my installation finished I was presented
            with a brand new Windows 10, through this I could help companies deploy many computers at once and cut down on installation time
            by sometimes exponential effeciency.

        <h3>Ubuntu Server PXE Boot</h3>
        <p><i>*High Level Description*</i></p>
        <p>
            I created a server using one of the Linux/GNU operating system distributions, I implemented a DHCP server that can than install 
            more Linux OS on the network that the server sits on. With this implemented in data centers where Ubuntu Server and other Linux OS
            are prevelant, this can save hours upon hours labor time.
        </p>
        <p><i>*Low Level Description*</i></p>
        <p>
            I installed PXElinux, TFTP server, syslinux, apache2, and isc-dhcp on Ubuntu 20.04 Kernel 5.8. First thing I did was ensure that
            my DHCP server is the main controller, I verified that through another device connecting without my server running was unable to
            get an IP from my network, than started my server and was able to get an IP. I than configured the TFTP server to a specific folder 
            which will in turn be where my PXE Boot files sit. Verify the TFTP server works on my network by trying from another device and 
            from the running server. Next I download and mount the Ubuntu 20.04 ISO, copy the initrd and vmlinuz from the ISO directory and into 
            my TFTP server directory. I unmount the Ubuntu ISO and move it to the apache2 directory, I verify I can download the iso from the 
            server's LAN IP to another pc on the network. I start my PXE Client to be greeted with an IP address from my server and the client 
            downloads the vmlinuz along with the initrd which kick starts the pxelinux.cfg/default file as a somewhat grub boot commandline.
